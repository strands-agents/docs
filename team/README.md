# Team Documentation

This folder contains internal documentation about how the Strands team builds and maintains the SDK. These documents help contributors understand our design philosophy and decision-making process.

## For Contributors

When proposing changes to the SDK, please review these documents to understand:

- **Tenets** — The principles your contribution should align with
- **Decisions** — Past decisions that may inform your approach
- **API Bar Raising** — The review process for API changes

If your contribution results in a new decision that could guide future work, consider adding it to [DECISIONS.md](./DECISIONS.md).
