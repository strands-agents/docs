# Contribute

There are different ways to contribute to the Strands ecosystem. You can improve the core SDK, help with documentation, or build extensions that others can use.

## SDK contributions

These contributions improve the SDK powering every Strands agent.

| I want to... | What it involves | Guide |
|--------------|------------------|-------|
| Fix a bug | Check for existing issues, submit a PR with tests that verify your fix | [SDK](./contributing/core-sdk.md) |
| Add a new feature | For small changes, open an issue first. For larger features, write a design document to align on direction | [Feature Proposals](./contributing/feature-proposals.md) |
| Improve the docs | Fix typos, clarify explanations, add examples, or write new guides | [Documentation](./contributing/documentation.md) |

## Extensions

You can share your tools, model providers, hooks, and session managers with the community by publishing them as packages.
