# Strands Agents SDK

[Strands Agents]({{ sdk_repo_home }}) is a simple-to-use, code-first framework for building agents.

First, install the Strands Agents SDK:

```bash
pip install strands-agents
```

Then create your first agent as a Python file, for this example we'll use `agent.py`.

```python
from strands import Agent

# Create an agent with default settings
agent = Agent()

# Ask the agent a question
agent("Tell me about agentic AI")
```

Now run the agent with:

```bash
python -u agent.py
```

That's it!

> **Note**: To run this example hello world agent you will need to set up credentials for our model provider and enable model access. The default model provider is [Amazon Bedrock](user-guide/concepts/model-providers/amazon-bedrock.md) and the default model is Claude 3.7 Sonnet in the US Oregon (us-west-2) region.

> For the default Amazon Bedrock model provider, see the [Boto3 documentation](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/credentials.html) for setting up AWS credentials. Typically for development, AWS credentials are defined in `AWS_` prefixed environment variables or configured with `aws configure`. You will also need to enable Claude 3.7 model access in Amazon Bedrock, following the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-access-modify.html) to enable access.

> Different model providers can be configured for agents by following the [quickstart guide](user-guide/quickstart.md#model-providers).
