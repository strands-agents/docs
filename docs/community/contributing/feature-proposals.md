# Feature Proposals

Building a significant feature takes time. Before you invest that effort, we want to make sure we're aligned on direction. That's why we use an RFC (Request for Comments) process for larger contributions.

This isn't bureaucracy for its own sake—it's about making sure your work has the best chance of being merged.

## When to use an RFC

Not every contribution needs an RFC. Use this process for changes that have broad impact.

| Use RFC for | Skip RFC for |
|-------------|--------------|
| New major features affecting multiple parts of the SDK | Bug fixes |
| Breaking changes to existing APIs | Small improvements |
| Architectural changes | Documentation updates |
| Large contributions (> 1 week of work) | New tools in your own repo |

## Process

1. **Check the [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/strands-agents/projects/1)** — See if your idea aligns with our direction
2. **Open a GitHub Discussion** — Use the [Proposals](https://github.com/strands-agents/sdk-python/discussions/categories/proposals) category
3. **Use the template** — Describe the problem, your solution, and alternatives
4. **Gather feedback** — We'll discuss with you and the community
5. **Get approval** — Wait for maintainer approval before implementing
6. **Implement** — Follow the [SDK contribution process](./core-sdk.md)

## Proposal template

When you open a discussion, use this structure.

```markdown
## Problem
What problem are you trying to solve?

## Proposed Solution
How would you solve it?

## Alternatives Considered
What other approaches did you consider?

## Willingness to Implement
Are you willing to implement this if approved?
```

This process helps us avoid situations where someone builds a feature for weeks, only to find it doesn't fit the project direction. We'd rather have that conversation early.
