# Community

The Strands community extends the SDK's capabilities through bug fixes, new tools, and improved documentation. Whether you're scratching your own itch or helping others, we're glad you're here.

Every contribution makes Strands better—from fixing a typo in the docs to building a new integration that helps thousands of developers. This section guides you through the different ways to contribute and helps you find the right path for your contribution.
