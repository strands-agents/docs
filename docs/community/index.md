# Community

The Strands community extends the SDK's capabilities through bug fixes, new tools, and improved documentation. Whether you're scratching your own itch or helping others, we're glad you're here.

## I want to fix a bug

Found something broken in the SDK? Bug fixes are always welcome. Check if there's an existing issue first, then submit a PR with a test that verifies your fix.

→ [Contributing to Core SDK](./contributing/core-sdk.md)

## I want to add a new feature

Have an idea for improving the SDK? For small changes, open an issue to discuss your approach. For larger features, we use an RFC process to align on direction before you invest significant time.

→ [Feature Proposals](./contributing/feature-proposals.md)

## I want to build a tool or integration

Built something useful? Publish it as your own package on PyPI. We provide templates to make this easy, and list community packages in our catalog so others can discover your work.

→ [Publishing Your Component](./publishing/index.md)

## I want to improve the docs

Spotted a typo, unclear explanation, or missing example? Documentation improvements help everyone learn faster. From fixing typos to adding new guides, all improvements are welcome.

→ [Contributing to Documentation](./contributing/documentation.md)
