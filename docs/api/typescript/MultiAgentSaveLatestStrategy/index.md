Defined in: [src/session/session-manager.ts:51](https://github.com/strands-agents/sdk-typescript/blob/714aa5fa654cfa8ea39cf6fea0813dd27b2f39e9/strands-ts/src/session/session-manager.ts#L51)

Controls when `snapshot_latest` is saved for multi-agent orchestrators.

-   `'node'`: after every node invocation completes (default; enables resume from the last completed node after a crash or restart)
-   `'invocation'`: after every orchestrator invocation completes (lower I/O, but only captures state at orchestrator invocation boundaries)
