Reason why the model stopped generating content.

-   `contentFiltered` - Content was filtered by safety mechanisms
-   `endTurn` - Natural end of the model’s turn
-   `guardrailIntervened` - A guardrail policy stopped generation
-   `maxTokens` - Maximum token limit was reached
-   `stopSequence` - A stop sequence was encountered
-   `toolUse` - Model wants to use a tool
-   `modelContextWindowExceeded` - Input exceeded the model’s context window
