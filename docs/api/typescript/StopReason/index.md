Defined in: [src/types/messages.ts:646](https://github.com/strands-agents/sdk-typescript/blob/9d6ae1a310097815db085f4d3aec6ec8f0057c1b/strands-ts/src/types/messages.ts#L646)

Reason why the model stopped generating content.

-   `cancelled` - Agent invocation was cancelled via `agent.cancel()`
-   `contentFiltered` - Content was filtered by safety mechanisms
-   `endTurn` - Natural end of the model’s turn
-   `guardrailIntervened` - A guardrail policy stopped generation
-   `interrupt` - Agent execution was interrupted for human input
-   `maxTokens` - Maximum token limit was reached
-   `stopSequence` - A stop sequence was encountered
-   `toolUse` - Model wants to use a tool
-   `modelContextWindowExceeded` - Input exceeded the model’s context window
