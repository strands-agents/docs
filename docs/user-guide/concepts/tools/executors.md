# Tool Executors

Tool executors allow users to customize the execution strategy of tools executed by the agent (e.g., concurrent vs sequential). Currently, Strands is packaged with 2 executors.

## Concurrent Executor

Use `ConcurrentToolExecutor` (the default) to execute tools concurrently:

```python
from strands import Agent
from strands.tools.executors import ConcurrentToolExecutor

agent = Agent(
    tool_executor=ConcurrentToolExecutor(), 
    tools=[weather_tool, time_tool]
)
# or simply Agent(tools=[weather_tool, time_tool])

agent("What is the weather and time in New York?")
```

Assuming the model returns `weather_tool` and `time_tool` use requests, the `ConcurrentToolExecutor` will execute both concurrently.

### Sequential Behavior

On certain prompts, the model may decide to return one tool use request at a time. Under these circumstances, the tools will execute sequentially. Concurrency is only achieved if the model returns multiple tool use requests in a single response. Certain models however offer additional abilities to coherce a desired behavior. For example, Anthropic exposes an explicit parallel tool use setting ([docs](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/tool-use/implement-tool-use#parallel-tool-use)).

## Sequential Executor

Use `SequentialToolExecutor` to execute tools sequentially:

```python
from strands import Agent
from strands.tools.executors import SequentialToolExecutor

agent = Agent(
    tool_executor=SequentialToolExecutor(), 
    tools=[screenshot_tool, email_tool]
)

agent("Please take a screenshot and then email the screenshot to my friend")
```

Assuming the model returns `screenshot_tool` and `email_tool` use requests, the `SequentialToolExecutor` will execute both sequentially in the order given.

## Custom Executor

Custom tool executors are not currently supported but are planned for a future release. You can track progress on this feature at [GitHub Issue #762](https://github.com/strands-agents/sdk-python/issues/762).
