# Structured Output

Structured output enables you to get type-safe, validated responses from language models using [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/concepts/models/) models. Instead of receiving raw text that you need to parse, you can define the exact structure you want and receive a validated Python object that matches your schema. This transforms unstructured LLM outputs into reliable, program-friendly data structures that integrate seamlessly with your application's type system and validation rules.

    D --> E[AgentResult.structured_output]
```
Key benefits:

- **Type Safety**: Get typed Python objects instead of raw strings
- **Automatic Validation**: Pydantic validates responses against your schema
- **Clear Documentation**: Schema serves as documentation of expected output
- **IDE Support**: IDE type hinting from LLM-generated responses
- **Error Prevention**: Catch malformed responses early

## How It Works

The structured output system converts your Pydantic models into tool specifications that guide the language model to produce correctly formatted responses. All of the model providers supported in Strands can work with Structured Output.

Strands handles this by accepting the `structured_output_model` parameter to agent invocations, which manages the conversion, validation, and response processing automatically. The validated result is available in the `AgentResult.structured_output` field.

## Usage

Define your desired output structure using Pydantic models:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import Optional, List

class PersonInfo(BaseModel):
    """Model that contains information about a Person"""
    name: str = Field(description="Name of the person")
    age: int = Field(description="Age of the person")
    occupation: str = Field(description="Occupation of the person")
```

Then use the `structured_output_model` parameter in your agent invocations as shown in the following sections.

### Basic Usage

Extract structured information from text by passing the `structured_output_model` parameter:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from strands import Agent

class PersonInfo(BaseModel):
    name: str
    age: int
    occupation: str

agent = Agent()
result = agent(
    "John Smith is a 30 year-old software engineer",
    structured_output_model=PersonInfo
)

print(f"Name: {result.structured_output.name}")      # "John Smith"
print(f"Age: {result.structured_output.age}")        # 30
print(f"Job: {result.structured_output.occupation}") # "software engineer"
```

###  Structured Output agent with Auto Retries

Automatically retry validation when initial extraction fails due to field validators:

```python
from strands.agent import Agent
from pydantic import BaseModel, field_validator


class Name(BaseModel):
    first_name: str

    @field_validator("first_name")
    @classmethod
    def validate_first_name(cls, value: str) -> str:
        if not value.endswith('abc'):
            raise ValueError("You must append 'abc' to the end of my name")
        return value 


agent = Agent() 
result = agent("What is Aaron's name?", structured_output_model=Name)
```


###  Structured Output agent with Streaming

Stream structured output progressively while maintaining type safety and validation:

```python
from strands import Agent
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class WeatherForecast(BaseModel):
    """Weather forecast data."""
    location: str
    temperature: int
    condition: str
    humidity: int
    wind_speed: int
    forecast_date: str

streaming_agent = Agent()

async for event in streaming_agent.stream_async(
    "Generate a weather forecast for Seattle: 68Â°F, partly cloudy, 55% humidity, 8 mph winds, for tomorrow",
    structured_output_model=WeatherForecast
):
    if "data" in event:
        print(event["data"], end="", flush=True)
    elif "result" in event:
        print(f'The forcast for today is: {event["result"].structured_output}')
```


###  Structured Output agent with other tools

Combine structured output with tool usage to format tool execution results:

```python
from strands import Agent
from strands_tools import calculator
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class MathResult(BaseModel):
    operation: str = Field(description="the performed operation")
    result: int = Field(description="the result of the operation")

tool_agent = Agent(
    tools=[calculator]
)
res = tool_agent("What is 42 + 8", structured_output_model=MathResult)
```

###  Many Invocations with a Single Agent and different Structured Output types

Reuse a single agent instance with different structured output models for varied extraction tasks:

```python
from strands import Agent
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class Person(BaseModel):
    """A person's basic information"""
    name: str = Field(description="Full name")
    age: int = Field(description="Age in years", ge=0, le=150)
    email: str = Field(description="Email address")
    phone: Optional[str] = Field(description="Phone number", default=None)

class Task(BaseModel):
    """A task or todo item"""
    title: str = Field(description="Task title")
    description: str = Field(description="Detailed description")
    priority: str = Field(description="Priority level: low, medium, high")
    completed: bool = Field(description="Whether task is completed", default=False)


agent = Agent()
person_res = agent("Extract person: John Doe, 35, john@test.com", structured_output_model=Person)
task_res = agent("Create task: Review code, high priority, completed", structured_output_model=Task)
```


### Using Conversation History

Extract structured information from prior conversation context without repeating questions:

```python
from strands import Agent
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import Optional

agent = Agent()

# Build up conversation context
agent("What do you know about Paris, France?")
agent("Tell me about the weather there in spring.")

class CityInfo(BaseModel):
    city: str
    country: str
    population: Optional[int] = None
    climate: str

# Extract structured information from the conversation
result = agent(
    "Extract structured information about Paris from our conversation",
    structured_output_model=CityInfo
)

print(f"City: {result.structured_output.city}")     # "Paris"
print(f"Country: {result.structured_output.country}") # "France"
```

### Nested Models

Handle sophisticated data structures with multiple levels of nesting and complex relationships:

```python
from typing import List, Optional
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from strands import Agent


class Address(BaseModel):
    street: str
    city: str
    country: str
    postal_code: Optional[str] = None

class Contact(BaseModel):
    email: Optional[str] = None
    phone: Optional[str] = None

class Person(BaseModel):
    """Complete person information."""
    name: str = Field(description="Full name of the person")
    age: int = Field(description="Age in years")
    address: Address = Field(description="Home address")
    contacts: List[Contact] = Field(default_factory=list, description="Contact methods")
    skills: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list, description="Professional skills")

agent = Agent()
result = agent(
    "Extract info: Jane Doe, a systems admin, 28, lives at 123 Main St, New York, NY. Email: jane@example.com",
    structured_output_model=Person
)

print(result.structured_output.name)                    # "Jane Doe"
print(result.structured_output.address.city)            # "New York"
print(result.structured_output.contacts[0].email)       # "jane@example.com"
print(result.structured_output.skills)                  # ["systems admin"]
```


### Agent-Level Default

Set a default structured output model that applies to all agent invocations:

```python
class PersonInfo(BaseModel):
    name: str
    age: int
    occupation: str

# Set default structured output model for all invocations
agent = Agent(structured_output_model=PersonInfo)
result = agent("John Smith is a 30 year-old software engineer")

print(f"Name: {result.structured_output.name}")      # "John Smith"
print(f"Age: {result.structured_output.age}")        # 30
print(f"Job: {result.structured_output.occupation}") # "software engineer"
```

!!! note "Note"
    Since this is on the agent init level, not the invocation level, the expectation is that the agent will attempt structured output for each invocation.


### Overriding Agent Default

Override the agent's default structured output model for specific invocations that require different schemas:

```python
class PersonInfo(BaseModel):
    name: str
    age: int
    occupation: str

class CompanyInfo(BaseModel):
    name: str
    industry: str
    employees: int

# Agent with default PersonInfo model
agent = Agent(structured_output_model=PersonInfo)

# Override with CompanyInfo for this specific call
result = agent(
    "TechCorp is a software company with 500 employees",
    structured_output_model=CompanyInfo
)

print(f"Company: {result.structured_output.name}")      # "TechCorp"
print(f"Industry: {result.structured_output.industry}") # "software"
print(f"Size: {result.structured_output.employees}")    # 500
```





Refer to Pydantic documentation for details on:

- [Models and schema definition](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/concepts/models/)
- [Field types and constraints](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/concepts/fields/)
- [Custom validators](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/concepts/validators/)


### Error Handling

In the event there is an issue with parsing the structured output, Strands will throw a custom `StructuredOutputException` that can be caught and handled appropriately:

```python
from pydantic import ValidationError
from strands.types.exceptions import StructuredOutputException

try:
    result = agent(prompt, structured_output_model=MyModel)
except StructuredOutputException as e:
    print(f"Structured output failed: {e}")
```

### Async Support

Everything mentioned above also works via the async `invoke_async` method:

```python
import asyncio
from pydantic import BaseModel
from strands import Agent

class PersonInfo(BaseModel):
    name: str
    age: int
    occupation: str

async def get_structured_output():
    agent = Agent()
    result = await agent.invoke_async(
        "John Smith is a 30-year-old software engineer",
        structured_output_model=PersonInfo
    )
    return result.structured_output

person_info = asyncio.run(get_structured_output())
```


## Migration from Legacy API

!!! warning "Deprecated API"
    The `Agent.structured_output()` and `Agent.structured_output_async()` methods are deprecated. Use the new `structured_output_model` parameter approach instead.

### Before (Deprecated)

```python
# Old approach - deprecated
result = agent.structured_output(PersonInfo, "John is 30 years old")
print(result.name)  # Direct access to model fields
```

### After (Recommended)

```python
# New approach - recommended
result = agent("John is 30 years old", structured_output_model=PersonInfo)
print(result.structured_output.name)  # Access via structured_output field
```


## Best Practices

- **Keep models focused**: Define specific models for clear purposes
- **Use descriptive field names**: Include helpful descriptions with `Field`
- **Handle errors gracefully**: Implement proper error handling strategies with fallbacks
