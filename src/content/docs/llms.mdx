## Markdown-Friendly Documentation

This documentation site provides clean, markdown-formatted content optimized for both humans and AI agents. Whether you're reading in a terminal, feeding docs to an LLM, or building tooling around our documentation, you'll get well-structured markdown without HTML noise.

### Available Endpoints

- [`/llms.txt`](/llms.txt) - Index file with links to all documentation pages in their raw markdown format, organized by section
- [`/llms-full.txt`](/llms-full.txt) - Complete documentation content in a single file (excludes API reference)

### Raw Markdown Convention

Every documentation page is available in raw markdown format by appending `/index.md` to its URL path:

- `/user-guide/quickstart/` → `/user-guide/quickstart/index.md`
- `/user-guide/concepts/tools/` → `/user-guide/concepts/tools/index.md`

This gives you clean, rendered markdown content without HTML markup, navigation, or styling - just the documentation content with properly resolved links.
